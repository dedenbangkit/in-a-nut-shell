# Kurzgesagt

Kurzgesagt (/ˌkʊərtsɡəˈzɑːkt/) is a German animation studio founded by Philipp Dettmer. The studio's YouTube channel focuses on minimalist animated educational content, using the flat design style. It discusses scientific, technological, political, philosophical and psychological subjects. Narrated by Steve Taylor, videos on the channel are typically 4–16 minutes in length, with each available in German through the channel Dinge Erklärt – Kurzgesagt. With over 10 million subscribers, the studio's channel was ranked as the world's 511th most subscribed in 2019. 

The name derives from the German kurz gesagt (IPA: ˈkʊɐ̯ts gəˈzaːkt), which directly translates to "said in short".It has also been translated as 'in brief' or 'in a nutshell', the latter being used as an English subtitle for the channel's name.
